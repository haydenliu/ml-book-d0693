          The book is a great practical resource for those interested in
          applying ML techniques quickly. As other reviewers have mentioned, it
          is a bit light on theory and the more technical aspects of ML until
          you get deeper into the book. Having said that, the examples and code
          provided are very practical and to the point. I would recommend it if
          you are either already familiar with basic ML theory and the math
          behind it or if you have a software engineering background and are
          simply looking to quickly implement an ML solution. The author walks
          you through code segments and explains each step and by the end, you
          will have covered most of the more popular ML models and know which
          ones to use given your data and your goals.

        subtitle: 'Brandon Guidelines, Marketing Guru'
        content: |-
          **Marketing in the real world** is very different than what we learn
          at school. If you've recently graduated and are making your first
          steps in the business, it's imperative that you know how to use the
          tools and tricks of the trade.


          > **The world of marketing has changed dramatically in the last 10
          years. Those who understand it, will succeed. But those who stay
          behind, will have a lot to catch up on.”**


          In this book I will teach you everything I know about B2B marketing.
          From branding, marketing planning, content creation, SEO and PPC, to
          segmenting your audience and understanding today's metrics and
          analytics methodologies — this guide is the only marketing education
          you'll ever need.
